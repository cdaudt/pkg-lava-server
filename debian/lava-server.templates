_Description: Is this a standalone master instance of LAVA?
 LAVA can be set up in either of two ways: as a single standalone
 master instance with attached devices, or in a distributed
 configuration with a central master instance and remote dispatchers
 providing (more) devices.
 .
 Configuration of remote dispatchers requires manual intervention,
 so the standalone configuration is recommended.

Template: lava-worker/db-server
Type: string
_Description: Master scheduler for this worker:
 Each remote worker needs to connect to a master scheduler
 running lava-server. This hostname or IP address will be
 used to connect to the master database.
 .
 To work with remote nodes, the master needs to be configured
 to allow the database to listen to the workers. An SSH key also
 needs to be generated on the worker and added to the master list
 of authorized_keys. Ensure that the master allows remote access
 from workers before submitting jobs or health checks.
 .
 You can continue setting up the worker, as long as
 remote database access is enabled before jobs are submitted.
